# Core ML Lab Demo

This is the finished product from my lab that I gave at SwiftFest (and AltConf!)

This iOS project should build out of the box once you are able to build onto an iOS device. I included a model that is trained to recognize the following objects:

- apple
- beer bottle
- banana
- sunglasses

Tapping the "X" button on the [Lumina](https://github.com/dokun1/lumina) camera screen will "reset" the game. Show your camera to each object and you'll "find it".

Feel free to explore the source code and play around!!
